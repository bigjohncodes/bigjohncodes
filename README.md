## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a passionate and results-driven software developer with expertise in building web, mobile, and desktop applications. My core focus lies in architecting and developing scalable, high-performance systems that solve real-world problems â€” particularly within distributed systems and modern software architectures.

Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I explore and prototype innovative solutions through hands-on research. The architectures and projects featured in my repositories are the direct outcome of my independent investigations and technical experimentation.

I specialize in crafting robust backend systems using technologies such as Java, Python, JavaScript, and PHP. I leverage event-driven architectures and microservices patterns to deliver resilient, extensible, and enterprise-grade applications capable of adapting to complex, real-time business environments.
